# Object-Tracing_Robot-Grabbing

##**Using OpenCV library in Pythons communicating with an Arduino Uno through the Serial Port to control a conveyor if a certain product depends on its color.**

_This application of image processing concepts can be implemented in production lines with assistance of a robot arm to improve its efficiency._

~~in our demo we used a Small Robot Arm for now, when we finish the  Project we will update the repository :) ~~

**The code works as follows:**

- Detects a certain product on the conveyor 
- Sends a signal to the Arduino to stop the conveyor 
- When the product reaches a certain position, it is removed from the conveyor by the Robot 
arm
