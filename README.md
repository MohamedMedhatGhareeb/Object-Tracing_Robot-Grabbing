# Object-Tracing_Robot-Grabbing

##**Using OpenCV library in Pythons communicating with an Arduino Uno throw the Serial Port to control a conveyor if a certain product depends on its color.**

_This application of image processing concepts can be implemented in production lines with assistance of a robot arm to improve its efficiency._
~~in our demo we initially used a human arm for now,  when the we finish the Robot Arm Project we will update the repository :) ~~

**The code works as follows:**

- Detects a certain product on the conveyor 
- Sends a signal to the Arduino to stop the conveyor when the product reaches a certain position until it is removed from the conveyor
- The conveyor resumes its work again
